The API call to get an object is GetObject For more information on S3 GetObject, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html Question 9: Correct You are maintaining an application that is spread across multiple web servers and has incoming traffic balanced by ELB. The application allows users to upload pictures. Currently each web server stores the image and a background task synchronizes the data between servers. However the synchronization task can no longer keep up with the number of images uploadedWhat change could you make so that all web servers have a place to store and read images at the same time? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.For more information on AWS S3, please refer to the below URL:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html Question 10: Correct Which of the following is a highly available, scalable deployment model for a web service. Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances By default all other answers are wrong because they have fixed number which is wrong for scalable deployment. For more information on Autoscaling, please refer to the below URL: https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ Question 11: Correct A security system monitors 3000 cameras saving image metadata every 30 seconds to an Amazon DynamoDB. Each sample involves writing 512 bytes of data and the writes are evenly distributed over time.How much write throughput is required for the target table. Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation When we round off the item size to 1KB, we get 1 write per item. Since there are 3000 cameras saving data every 30 seconds , means that there are 3000 writes per 30 seconds and (3000/30) = 100 writes per second.

Choose a correct answer from the options below  Explanation Parameters - Specifies values that you can pass in to your template at runtime (when you create or update a stack). You can refer to parameters in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.For more information on Cloudformation templates please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.htmlAWS CloudFormation provides several built-in functions that help you manage your stacks. Use intrinsic functions in your templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime URL:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.htmlRegular expressions (commonly known as regexes) can be specified in a number of places within an AWS CloudFormation template, such as for the AllowedPattern property when creating a template parameter URL:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-regexes.html Question 28: Correct Which of the following is an incorrect S3 bucket name? Choose 2 correct answer from the options below  Explanation AWS Doc shows the naming conventions for S3 bucketsThe bucket name can be between 3 and 63 characters long, and can contain only lower-case characters, numbers, periods, and dashes.Each label in the bucket name must start with a lowercase letter or number.The bucket name cannot contain underscores, end with a dash, have consecutive periods, or use dashes adjacent to periods.The bucket name cannot be formatted as an IP address (198.51.100.24).For more information on the S3 naming conventions please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-s3-bucket-naming-requirements.html Question 29: Correct What would you set in your CloudFormation template to fire up different instance sizes based off of environment type? i.e. (If this is for prod, use m1.large instead of t1.micro) Choose a correct answer from the options below  Explanation The optional Conditions section includes statements that define when a resource is created or when a property is defined. For example, you can compare whether a value is equal to another value. Based on the result of that condition, you can conditionally create resources. If you have multiple conditions, separate them with commas.For more information on Cloudformation conditions please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.htmlCloudFormation template comprises of various elements such as Parameters, Description, Outputs, Mappings, Conditions, Format Versions, Metadata, Resources etc out of which Resources is the only section which is mandatory for it to function, rest are all Optional.Outputs: This section declares output values that you can import into other stacks.Resources: Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket.Mappings:This section matches a key to a corresponding set of named values. For example, if you want to set values based on a region, you can create a mapping that uses the region name as a key and contains the values you want to specify for each specific region.However it does not support parameters, pseudo parameters, or intrinsic functions.Conditions: This section controls whether certain resources are created or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a production or test environment.For the production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use reduced capabilities to save money. With conditions, you can define which resources are created and how they're configured for each environment type.So in this scenario, we need to launch various instance types either to production or to test environment. We don't require large instances for test purposes. Hence the condition section checks whether the instance that need to be launched is for Prod or test environment based on the values provided during stack creation. More information is available on the following links:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html Question 30: Correct You're creating a forum DynamoDB database for hosting web forums. Your \"thread\" table contains the forum name and each \"forum name\" can have one or more \"subjects\". What primary key type would you give the thread table in order to allow more than one subject to be tied to the forum primary key name? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term hash attribute derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term range attribute derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.For more information on the core components of DynamoDB please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html Question 31: Correct You need to announce an emergency downtime for a production AWS web application. This downtime notification will require different sets of instructions for different devices. All of the application users signed up to receive SNS notifications from the ‚Äúmywebapp‚Äù topic when they began using the application and they are currently subscribed to this topic. What are appropriate ways for you to provide timely, device-specific instructions to end users when announcing this downtime? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation In addition to sending custom data as key-value pairs, you can also send platform-specific key-value pairs within the JSON payload. For example, if you wanted to include time_to_live and collapse_key GCM parameters after the custom data key-value pairs included in the data GCM parameter, then the JSON payload without escaped quotation marks would look similar to the following:{   \"GCM\":\"{      \"data\":{         \"message\":\"Check out these awesome deals!\",         \"url\":\"www.amazon.com\"      },         \"time_to_live\": 3600,         \"collapse_key\": \"deals\"   }\"}For more information on customizing SNS messages please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html Question 32: Correct Which of these CloudFormation snippets of code will return an address that can be used to access our application from our browser if we're using a resource type of AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer with Logical ID \"ElasticLoadBalancer\"? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation We have to use the Fn::GetAtt to get the DNSName of the Elastic load balancer. Hence option B and D are wrong. Then we don‚Äôt need any delimiter, hence Option C is wrong. For more information on Fn::GetAtt command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html Question 33: Correct Your supervisor is upset about the fact that SNS topics that he subscribed to are now cluttering up his email inbox. How can he stop receiving email from SNS without disrupting other users‚Äô ability to receive email from SNS? Choose 2 answers from the options below  Explanation Every request has a unsubscribe URL which can be used. Also from the aws console , one can just delete the subscription For more information on SNS subscription please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html Question 34: Correct You have an Amazon S3 bucket that you use to store objects. You'd like to encrypt some of the new objects you upload to this bucket. What header do you need to use in order to request server-side encryption when using the REST API? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.Amazon S3 supports bucket policies that you can use if you require server-side encryption for all objects that are stored in your bucket. For this you need to set the header as x-amz-server-side-encryption in the REST API call.For more information on S3 server side encryption, please refer to the below URL:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Question 35: Correct At what size does does AWS recommend customers to use the multi-part upload tool when uploading object to S3?  Explanation This is clearly mentioned in the AWS documentation For more information on S3 please refer to the below URL: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/ Question 36: Correct If your table item's size is 3KB and you want to have 90 strongly consistent reads per second, how many read capacity units will you need to provision on the table? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation When we round off the item size to 4KB, we get 1 read per item. Since there are 90 requests , it means 90 reads per seconds. For more information on provisioned throughtput, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.html Question 37: Correct What kind of message does SNS send to endpoints? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation AWS documentation on the format of the SNS message. There is no source , hence Option A and B are wrong. And since SNS messages are JSON, only option C is correct. For more information on sending SNS messages, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.html Question 38: Correct Your EC2 component receives a message from a message queue. The message will then become invisible for 30 seconds. What is the ideal API request must be called in order to ensure that the message does not become visible again.  Explanation This is clearly given in the AWS documentation that you have to delete the message after it is processed. For more information on visibility timeout, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Question 39: Correct Which of the following are supported platforms in Elastic Beanstalk? Choose 2 correct answer from the options below  Explanation This is clearly given in the AWS documentation For more information on elastic beanstalk, please refer to the below URL: https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/faqs/ Question 40: Correct Your application instance takes 60 seconds to process instructions received in an SQS message. Assuming the SQS queue is configured with the default Visibility Timeout, what is the best way to configure your application to ensure that no other instances retrieve a message that has already been processed or is currently being processed? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not be available for 30 seconds until the message is processed. So you need to increase the visibility timeout to 60 seconds , then read the message and then delete it. For more information on SQS visibility timeout, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Question 41: Correct Your supervisor asks you to find a solution for scheduling a sequence of tasks. The sequence may take several months to complete and it‚Äôs very important that no tasks are processed more than once. What AWS service should you recommend? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation The benefits of SWF are clearly mentioned in the documentation When building solutions to coordinate tasks in a distributed environment, developers have to account for several variables. Tasks that drive processing steps can be long-running and may fail, timeout, or require restarts. They often complete with varying throughputs and latencies. Tracking and visualizing tasks in all these cases is not only challenging, but is also undifferentiated work. As applications and tasks scale up, developers face difficult distributed systems‚Äô problems. For example, they must ensure that a task is assigned only once and that its outcome is tracked reliably through unexpected failures and outages. By using Amazon SWF, developers can focus on their differentiated application logic, i.e. how to process tasks and how to coordinate them. For more information on SWF, please refer to the below URL: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/ Question 42: Correct A recent increase in the amount of users of an application hosted on an EC2 instance that you manage has caused the instance‚Äôs OS to run out of CPU resources and crash. The crash caused several users‚Äô unsaved data to be lost and your supervisor wants to know how this problem can be avoided in the future.Which of the following would you not recommend?  Explanation If you take snapshots during business hours , the situation can become worse since I/O is required to create the snapshot. Hence this is the worse solution to recommend for the problem. For more information on EBS snapshots, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html Question 43: Correct You are working with the S3 API and receive an error message: 409 Conflict. What is the possible cause of this error? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation This is clearly given in the AWS documentation for error codes For more information on all S3 error responses please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html Question 44: Correct You would like to set up a static website on S3 with the least possible effort. The URL of the website is unimportant to you. Which of the following steps are necessary? Choose 3 correct answer from the options below  Explanation When you go to S3, make sure that static website hosting is enabled. Also upload the index.html document , make sure it is Public and also ensure that it is put as the Index document. For more information on all S3 web site hosting please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html Question 45: Correct In SQS What does the setting, VisibilityTimeout = 0 have an effect on your message? Choose the correct answer from the options below  Explanation SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not be available for 30 seconds until the message is processed. But if you set the visibility timeout it would mean that the message would be available instantly. For more information on SQS visibility timeout, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Question 46: Correct A SWF workflow task or task execution can live up to ______ long?

Assume that no security Keys are allowed to be stored on the EC2 instance. Choose an answer from options below:  Explanation As the question mentions no keys are allowed to be stored on EC2 instance and hence IAM user is incorrect option. Statement from AWS with regard to controlling access to DynamoDB:  Applications running on Amazon EC2 ‚Äì You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances in the IAM User Guide. Please refer to the link below for more information:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/authentication-and-access-control.html Question 54: Correct An Amazon S3 bucket, ‚Äúmyawsbucket‚Äù is configured with website hosting in Tokyo region,what is the region-specific website endpoint? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation You have the chance to enable static web site hosting for S3 buckets. This can be done via the properties option for the bucket. The end point of the bucket for static hosting will also be configured. For more information on S3 buckets, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html Question 55: Correct You are providing AWS consulting services for a company developing a new mobile application that will be leveraging Amazon SNS Mobile Push for push notifications. In order to send direct notification messages to individual devices each device registration identifier or token needs to be registered with SNS; however the developers are not sure of the best way to do this. You advise them to  Explanation The CreatePlatformEndPoint  API creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. CreatePlatformEndpoint requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from CreatePlatformApplication. The EndpointArn that is returned when using CreatePlatformEndpointcan then be used by the Publish action to send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe action for subscription to a topic.  For more information on the command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreatePlatformEndpoint.html Question 56: Correct What type of block cipher does Amazon S3 offer for server side encryption? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data. The object creation REST APIs (see Specifying Server-Side Encryption Using the REST API) provide a request header, x-amz-server-side-encryption that you can use to request server-side encryption. For more information on S3 encryption, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html Question 57: Correct Which of the following is an example of a good DynamoDB hash key schema for provisioned throughput efficiency?

The S3 bucket currently has default permissions of all objects being private to prevent inadvertent exposure of the premier content to non-paying website visitors. How can Company A provide only paid subscribers the ability to download a premier content file in the S3 bucket?  Explanation A pre-signed URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the pre-signed URL has permissions to access that object. That is, if you receive a pre-signed URL to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the pre-signed URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object. For more information on Pre-signed urls , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html Question 59: Correct What happens, by default, when one of the resources in a CloudFormation stack cannot be created? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation By default, the ‚Äúautomatic rollback on error‚Äù feature is enabled. This will cause all AWS resources that AWS CloudFormation created successfully for a stack up to the point where an error occurred to be deleted. This is useful when, for example, you accidentally exceed your default limit of Elastic IP addresses, or you don‚Äôt have access to an EC2 AMI you‚Äôre trying to run. This feature enables you to rely on the fact that stacks are either fully created, or not at all, which simplifies system administration and layered solutions built on top of AWS CloudFormation. For more information on cloudformation, please refer to the below link: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs/ Question 60: Correct Which features can be used to restrict access to data in S3? Choose 2 answers from the options below  Explanation By default, all Amazon S3 resources‚Äîbuckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycleconfiguration and website configuration)‚Äîare private: only the resource owner, an AWS account that created it, can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. Amazon S3 offers access policy options broadly categorized as resource-based policies and user policies. Access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects) are referred to as resource-based policies. For example, bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) are resource-based policies. You can also attach access policies to users in your account. These are called user policies. You may choose to use resource-based policies, user policies, or some combination of these to manage permissions to your Amazon S3 resources. For more information on S3 access permissions please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Question 61: Correct You run an ad-supported photo sharing website using S3 to serve photos to visitors of your site. At some point you find out that other sites have been linking to the photos on your site, causing loss to your business. What is an effective method to mitigate this? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation A pre-signed URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the pre-signed URL has permissions to access that object. That is, if you receive a pre-signed URL to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the pre-signed URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object. For more information on Pre-signed urls , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html Question 62: Correct Games-R-Us is launching a new game app for mobile devices. Users will log into the game using their existing Facebook account and the game will record player data and scoring information directly to a DynamoDB table. What is the most secure approach for signing requests to the DynamoDB API? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) ‚Äîsuch as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.

Once an hour these items are analyzed and then are no longer needed. You need to minimize provisioned throughput, storage, and API calls. Given these requirements, what is the most efficient way to manage these Items after the analysis? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation The main point of the question is to minimize provisioned throughput.Option A is wrong because the table will grow and increase provisioned throughput.Option B is wrong because the table will grow and increase provisioned throughput over the 24 hour period.Option D is partially correct , you still need to delete the older table.For more information on DynamoDB provisioned throughput please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.html Question 64: Correct Company D is running their corporate website on Amazon S3 accessed from http//www.companyd.com. Their marketing team has published new web fonts to a separate S3 bucket accessed by the S3 endpoint https://s3-us-west1. amazonaws.com/cdfonts. While testing the new web fonts, Company D recognized the web fonts are being blocked by the browser. What should Company D do to prevent the web fonts from being blocked by the browser?  Explanation Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support in Amazon S3, you can build rich client-side web applications with Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross-origin access to your Amazon S3 resources. For more information on S3 CORS configuration, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html Question 65: Correct How is provisioned throughput affected by the chosen consistency model when reading data from a DynamoDB table? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation A unit of Write Capacity enables you to perform one write per second for items of up to 1KB in size. Similarly, a unit of Read Capacity enables you to perform one strongly consistent read per second (or two eventually consistent reads per second) of items of up to 4KB in size.  Hence the strong consistency is more expensive and uses more throughput than the eventual consistency.

These three instances can successfully communicate with other hosts on the Internet. You launch a fourth instance in the same subnet, using the same AMI and security group configuration you used for the others, but find that this instance cannot be accessed from the Internet. What should you do to enable internet access? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the Internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the Internet; for example, to connect to your instance from your local computer. For more information on Elastic IP, please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html Question 67: Correct After launching an instance that you intend to serve as a NAT (Network Address Translation) device in a public subnet you modify your route tables to have the NAT device be the target of internet bound traffic of your private subnet. When you try and make an outbound connection to the Internet from an instance in the private subnet, you are not successful. Which of the following steps could resolve the issue? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Each EC2 instance performs source/destination checks by default. This means that the instance must be the source or destination of any traffic it sends or receives. However, a NAT instance must be able to send and receive traffic when the source or destination is not itself. Therefore, you must disable source/destination checks on the NAT instance. For more information on NAT instance, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html Question 68: Correct When using a large Scan operation in DynamoDB, what technique can be used to minimize the impact of a scan on a table‚Äôs provisioned throughput? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation This is clearly given in the ASW documentation For more information on guidelines on queries and scans in dynamoDB, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScanGuidelines.html Question 69: Correct An application stores payroll information nightly in DynamoDB for a large number of employees across hundreds of offices. Item attributes consist of individual name, office identifier, and cumulative daily hours. Managers run reports for ranges of names working in their office. One query is. ‚ÄúReturn all Items in this office for names starting with A through E‚Äù. Which table configuration will result in the lowest impact on provisioned throughput for this query? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation Key points of this question to consider are 'large number of employees across hundreds of offices' and 'reports for ranges of names working in their office.'Answer B is ruled out because it assumes employee names are unique which might not be the case of 'large number of employees across hundreds of offices'.Answer D is obviously incorrect as it doesn't allow an office to have more than one employee. (hash key only model requires unique hashes.)Answer C makes employees of a single office to be spread over multiple partitions and requires a SCAN operation to generate reports for ranges of names working in a single office. This table configuration requires SCAN operations for reports for ranges of names working in an office. A SCAN operation is not recommended on large tables, because it can consume large amounts of system resources. (see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.ReadData.html)Answer A puts all employees of a single office in to a single hash. With configuring the table to have a range index on the name attribute, and a hash index on the office identifier, a QUERY operation is sufficient to generate reports like 'Return all Items in this office for names starting with A through E'. This table configuration results in the lowest impact on provisioned throughput. This is the optimal arrangement to accommodate regular 'reports for ranges of names working in an office.'Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.htmlhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.htmlhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.Rea Question 70: Correct What item operation allows the retrieval of multiple items from a DynamoDB table in a single API call? Choose an answer from the options below  Explanation The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem will return a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys For more information on the command, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetItem.html ","answers":["A.
